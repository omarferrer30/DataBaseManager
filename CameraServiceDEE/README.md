## Commands
In order to send a command to the camera service, a module must publish a message in the external (or internal) broker. The topic of the message must be in the form:
```
"XXX/cameraService/YYY"
```
where XXX is the name of the module requiring the service and YYY is the name of the service that is required. Some of the commands may require additional data that must be include in the payload of the message to be published.
In some cases, after completing the service requiered the camera service publish a message as an answer. The topic of the answer has the format:
```
"cameraService/XXX/ZZZ"
```
where XXX is the name of the module requiring the service and ZZZ is the answer. The message can include data in the message payload.

The table bellow indicates all the commands that are accepted by the canera service in the current version.

Command | Description | Payload | Answer | Answer payload
--- | --- | --- | --- |---
*takePicture* | provides a picture | No | *picture* | Yes (see Note 1)
*startVideoStream* | starts sending pictures every 0.2 seconds | No | *picture* |Yes (see Note 1)
*stopVideoStream* | stop sending pictures | No | No | No

Note 1
Pictures are encoded in base64, as shown here:
```
  ret, frame = cap.read()
  if ret:
      _, image_buffer = cv.imencode(".jpg", frame)
      jpg_as_text = base64.b64encode(image_buffer)
      client.publish(topic_to_publish, jpg_as_text)
```
