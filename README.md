# Drone Engineering Ecosystem: Data Base Manager for Flight Plans and Flights
This project has been developed as a contribution to the collaborative Drone Engineering Ecosystem (DEE). The main goal was to integrate a Data Base Manager within the existing Dashboard of the DEE. This tool is designed to facilitate the management and operation of flight plans and flights by interacting with both the ground and air APIs within the DEE. The application enables users to:

Visualize, duplicate, edit, and delete flight plans directly from the interface.
Manage flights, including visualization, duplication, and deletion.
Seamlessly integrate with the ground and air APIs for efficient data handling.
View flight paths and waypoints on a visual map with real-time data feedback.
Additionally, two new microservices were implemented to handle specific API requests, improving the communication between the dashboard and both the ground and air APIs. These microservices have enhanced the efficiency and flexibility of managing drone operations within the DEE.

The project serves as a key improvement to the DEE's existing functionalities, simplifying the workflow of handling data related to drone operations.

# Demo
To better understand how to use the Data Base Manager, I have prepared a demo video showcasing its functionalities. In this video, we demonstrate the step-by-step process of managing flight plans and flights through the interface, highlighting key features like duplicating and editing flight data.

And also a video explaining the code:
